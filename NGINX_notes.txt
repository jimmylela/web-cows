!! The problem is ALWAYS SELinux !!
    Try disabling and see if it works
    $ sudo setenforce 0

Different repos may have different versions
Distribution specific repos are sometimes outdated
Nginix recommends installing from their official repo
Debian/Ubuntu are different than RedHat and Ngini official
    A big difference is 
    Niginx official repo uses /conf.d/ directory
    Debian/Ubuntu uses the sites-enabled directory
    RedHat? don't care, use the official Nginx


Nginx directory for web files seems to be /var/www

##nginx troubleshooting
Server block name matches name in request host header?
Server block root directory has the file requested?
    Requested file's absolute path = server block root + path/file requested
    Eg
        server block root = /var/www/example.com
        file requested = /images/example_image.jpg
        file absolute path = /var/www/example.com/images/example_image.jpg
    Verify by looking at /var/log/nginx/error.log, look for full path


special characters in names?

Linux vs Windows line endings?
