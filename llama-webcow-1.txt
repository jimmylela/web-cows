20211117 (began)

Created new RHEL8 VPS in Azure Cloud

    Set username and chose SSH key

    Allowed 80, 443, and 22

Configured SecureCRT session to use key and SSH in to public IP

Adjusted network firewall rules to allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS from various home, work, and Hy-Vee IPs

$ sudo yum install -y nginx

Followed http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html

$ cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf ~/nginx.conf.bak.20211118

Commented out default server blocks

$ sudo start nginx

$ curl http://localhost

Returned a 403

$ cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.jimmy.20211120

$ cp ~/nginx.conf.bak.20211118 /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

sudo nginx -s reload

$ curl http://localhost

Now I get the default Nginx page

So the problem was with my config file

lots of troubleshooting, screwing with permissions

problem was selinux

$ setenforce 0

Now I can curl and get my page

Were any of my other changes needed?

    I changed the owner of /data/* to nginx

        $ sudo chown -R nginx:nginx /data/*

    I changed the permissions on /data/* to 755

        $ sudo chmod 755 /data 

        (repeated for all the subdirectories and files cause I didn't know how to recurse)

Renabled selinux

    $ sudo setenfore 1

Set selinx httpd_can_network_connect value to on

    $ sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on

Curl still returned 403

Changed selinx context for /data/www to httpd_sys_content_t

    $ chcon -Rt httpd_sys_content_t /data/www

 curl now works with selinux on!

So at least the context command was necessary

Maybe the selinux boolean command was necessary

Maybe the chown command was necessary

Maybe the chmod command was necessary

Connections from outside did not work, despite the Azure network being configured to allow them from the necessary IPs

Added firewall rules to allow http and https in from public zone

    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=http
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=https
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Connections from the allowed IPs now work and my index.html page loads!

Added /data/www/welcome.html with contents of ITA Group site down page with modifications

    Set image link to https://freesvg.org/img/Upper-class-llama.png (https://unsplash.com/photos/GZa4QFmv0Zg did not work for some reason, I think because of the file type or size)

Created Azure firewall rule to allow outbound HTTPS connections

Site loaded with pic and styling!  http://llama-webcow-1.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/welcome.html

Enabled Bismark or whatever for remote access, then saw how much it was going to cost and disabled it

Got serial console working from Azure, had to create a special storage account, not sure about charges
